# HR_analytics

The HR analytics dataset is obtained from Kaggle Human Resources Analytics dataset.

It shows details for last 5 years and contains the following fields:

* Employee satisfaction level, (range 0 to 1)
* Last evaluation, (range 0 to 1)
* Number of projects
* Average monthly, (in hours)
* Time spent at the company, (in years)
* Number of work accident
* Promotions in the last 5 years
* Sales (or job function)
* Salary (low, medium or high)
( Whether the employee has left the company or not

I have used logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest classifier and naive bayes classifier. Random Forest Classifier performed the best.
